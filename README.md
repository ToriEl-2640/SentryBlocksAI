SentryBlocksAI 🚀

Watch. Detect. Secure.

SentryBlocksAI – Simple Explanation

SentryBlocksAI is like a security guard for smart contracts. It helps developers check if their smart contracts are safe before deploying them on the blockchain. SentryBlocksAI is an AI-powered smart contract security auditor that leverages FastAPI, Next.js, and Nethermind's Ethereum tools to analyze, detect, and report security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

How It Works

1. You enter a smart contract → Copy-paste your contract code into the app.


2. SentryBlocksAI scans it → Uses AI and blockchain tools (like Nethermind) to find security risks.


3. You get a report → It tells you if the contract has vulnerabilities and how to fix them.



Tech Behind It

Backend (Brain) → Built with FastAPI, it runs the security checks.

Frontend (Face) → Built with Next.js, it gives you a simple UI to upload contracts.

Nethermind (Blockchain Expert) → Fetches live blockchain data to improve the scans.

AI (Detective) → Analyzes the smart contract to detect possible security issues.


Why It's Useful

✅ Saves Time – No need for manual security checks.
✅ Prevents Hacks – Helps avoid costly mistakes.
✅ Easy to Use – Simple interface, even for beginners.
